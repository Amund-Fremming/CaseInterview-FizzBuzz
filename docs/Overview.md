# CaseInterview-FizzBuzz Documentation

## Introduction to Rules Configuration

The CaseInterview-FizzBuzz application allows for the dynamic addition and modification of rules to enhance gameplay flexibility. This is facilitated through the `rules.json` file, which serves as a central repository for rule definitions.

### Adding New Rules

- Amend the `rules.json` file by inserting a new pair of "divisor" and "response" elements.

### Creating New Games with Custom Rule Sets

- To develop a new game variant with a unique set of rules, add a new JSON object within the `rules.json` file. This object should encapsulate the complete set of rules that define the gameplay mechanics of the new variant.

## Development and Implementation

### Initial Consideration

- Initially, the development approach was inclined towards enabling expansions through the creation of new classes representing individual rules. These classes were envisioned to implement a `Rule` interface (or a similar construct), thereby encapsulating the rule logic.
- However, considering the requirement to minimize the need for programming new logic for each rule, this approach was revisited.

### Final Implementation

- The adopted solution focuses on user-friendliness and simplicity. Users specify rules by entering a number (the divisor) and the desired output for cases where the game's number is divisible by this divisor.
- This approach eliminates the need for programming additional logic for each new rule. Instead, rules are defined in a straightforward, declarative manner in the `rules.json` file.
- The flexibility of this system also extends to the creation of new rule sets. These can either be used to design entirely new game variants or to augment existing sets with additional rules.
